# Multi Step Form Main

[The live site](https://danylosus.github.io/multi-step-form-main/)

## Why is it (site) existing?

Hello!:wave:
I am **Danylo Sushko**. I am **_Front-End React Developer_**.
I'm looking for a **job** so I wanted to create **something** which can shows what I know.:cowboy_hat_face:

## What is the project

I found a design (with images and a design) of the project on [Front-End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ).
I wanted to show my knowledge in libraries of forms with React.

## What have I used?

I have created the **_Multi Step Form Main_ **on **React** functional components with some **libraries**.
I have used:
  1. **JSX** (Functional Components).
  2. **SCSS/SASS** (for work with **Bootstrap**).
  3. **Bootstrap** (for faster writing design)
  4. **Framer Motion** (for animations on a technology page and a burger menu).
  5. **Redux** (for save and works with my forms and steps).
  6. **Formik** (for validation and save information)
  7. Main rules of **responsive design**.

Thank **you** for reading my **_README_**! :sunglasses::call_me_hand::thumbsup:
